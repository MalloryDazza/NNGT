Introduction
============

Why another graph library?
--------------------------

It is not ;)

This library is based on existing graph libraries (such as `graph-tool <https://graph-tool.skewed.de>`_, and possibly soon `SNAP <http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/>`_) and acts as a convenient interface to build various networks from efficient and verified algorithms.

Moreover, it also acts as an interface between those graph libraries and the NEST simulator.

Features
--------

Graph-theoretical models
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Several classical graphs are efficiently implemented and the generation procedures are detailed in the documentation.
