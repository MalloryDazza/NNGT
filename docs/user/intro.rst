Why another graph library?
--------------------------

It is not ;)
This library is based on existing graph libraries (such as `graph-tool <https://graph-tool.skewed.de>`, and possibly soon `SNAP <http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/>`) and acts as a convenient interface to build various networks from efficient and verified algorithms.

Moreover, it also acts as an interface between those graph libraries and the NEST simulator.
